a local first note app

## story behind
I haven been a big fan of outliner and rich text editor in browser to organize information. This note app started as my pilot when I experimented coding with LLM/ChatGPT, which turned out to be quite intereting experience (happy to share separately). Instead of just a pilot, I actually started using it on a daily basis as my note app. Soon after, I started wondering if I could program Clojure(script) with it, of which I am also a big fan. So I enhanced it with scittle, a great tool/module that translates Clojurescript to javascript and executes it in browser.
