# tippy
a local first note app

## story behind
I haven been a big fan of outliner and rich text editor in browser to organize information. This note app started as my pilot when I experimented coding with LLM/ChatGPT, which turned out to be quite intereting experience (happy to share separately). Instead of just a pilot, I actually started using it on a daily basis as my note app. Soon after, I started wondering if I could program Clojure(script) with it, of which I am also a big fan. So I enhanced it with scittle, a great tool/module that translates Clojurescript to javascript and executes it in browser. Along programming Clojurescript in this note app, I asked myself why don't I just use it to enhance and enrich the note app itself. My first attempt is to utilize html <template> to create custom element that can be used to host and edit content with pre-defined format (e.g. card) in the note app without any programming. I am actively testing it and planning to make it available soon.
